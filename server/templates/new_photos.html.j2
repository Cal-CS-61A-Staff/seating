  	<p>This page is still under construction; however, you may follow these instructions to have your photos added to your seating app. Download this <a href="https://github.com/Cal-CS-61A-Staff/seating/blob/master/download_bcourses_photos.py">script</a> and follow the instructions. You should send the slack a zip of the photos in the format of bcoursesID.jpeg (make sure it's not .jpg!). Photos will be added to the seating app shortly. </p>

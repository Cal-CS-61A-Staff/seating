    <h4><i class="material-icons help">room</i>Rooms.</h4>
    <p>There are two options: import a room via Google Sheet or choose from our available rooms.</p>
    <p>Room data is entered from a Google Sheet. Copy a sheet from the room <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cHKVheWv2JnHBorbtfZMW_3Sxj9VtGMmAUU2qGJ33-s/edit?usp=sharing">master sheet</a>. If it does not exist, you can try looking through the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B7ZiW-W5STesMG50eDgxNlJBZ1E">rooms</a> used in the past years.</p>
    <p>If it cannot be found, please make a sheet for the room and add it to the master.</p>

    <p>One row of the spreadsheet corresponds to one row. The "Row" and "Seat" columns
    specify the name of a seat. The "X" and "Y" are the coordinates in the seating
    chart. If "X" is left blank, it defaults to one space stage right (house left)
    to the previous seat. If "Y" is left blank, it defaults to the Y coordinate of
    the previous seat. The remaining columns are arbitrary TRUE/FALSE "attributes",
    which can give labels to seats such as LEFTY, RIGHTY, AISLE, FRONT, or RESERVED.
    A blank value is interpreted as FALSE. Student preferences are given in terms
    of these labels, and are used to match students to seats.</p>

    <p>Once your room is finalized, we would appreciate you adding the sheet to the
    Drive folder linked above so that other exams can use them. If you find that the
    seating chart we have provided is out of date (ie. broken seat), we would appreciate if you update
    the master seating doc.</p>

    <p>As of now, you can not yet delete rooms. Contact the Slack to have your room deleted.</p>

   <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
    <h4><i class="material-icons help">person_add</i>Students.</h4>
    <p>Create a spreadsheet with one row for each student that will be assigned a seat.
    It should have columns "Name", "Student ID", "Email", and "bCourses ID". The
    remaining columns are arbitrary attributes (ex: LEFTY, RIGHTY, BROKEN) that express student preferences. For
    example, if a student has LEFTY=TRUE, they will be assigned a seat with the
    LEFTY attribute. If a student has LEFTY=FALSE, they will be assigned a seat
    without the LEFTY attribute. If a student's LEFTY attribute is blank, i.e. TRUE
    nor FALSE, then they will could be assigned to either a LEFTY or non-LEFTY seat
    as if they don't care.</p>
    <p>You can add students to the spreadsheet and import them again later. Duplicates will be merged.</p>

    <p>It's easy to assign; simply click the Assign button. Only unassigned students will be assigned a seat.
    To reassign a student,message the CS 61A software support slack.</p>

    <p>
    Students will receive an email that looks like
```
Hi -name-,

Here's your assigned seat for -exam-:

Room: -room-

Seat: -seat-

You can view this seat's position on the seating chart at:
<domain>/seat/-seatid-/

-additional text-
```

The "additional text" is a good place to tell them what to do if they have an
issue with their seat, and to sign the email (e.g. "- Cal CS 61A Staff").
